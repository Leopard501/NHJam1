A story mod for Outer Wilds set in a new solar system.

### Known Issues
* Ghost matter isn't working at the moment, just pretend there is ghost matter around the Strange Precursor Ruin.
* Some structures don't have collision.
* The beam can still kill you even when it isn't visible, this only manifests in a particular late game area, just don't fly through the middle of it.
