A story mod for Outer Wilds set in a new solar system.

### Known Issues
* Ghost matter didn't work in the version I was testing, but it may have been fixed since then. If not, just pretend there is ghost matter around the Strange Precursor Ruin.
* Some structures don't have collision. Uhhhhh don't worry about it.
