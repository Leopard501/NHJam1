            <Page>Wait, you just completed your training? And Salmon gave you your first mission?</Page>
            <Page>Darn it! I can't believe it slipped my mind! I'm so sorry!</Page>
            <Page>I was thinking about how we could further increase fuel efficiency by rerouting excess power from the reactor to overclock the fuel pumps to reduce waste from fuel getting gummed up in the fuel lines...</Page>

            <Page>The South Village might have more information, I know they were monitoring the climate more closely.</Page>
            <Page>Theres also a Precursor ruin you can check out, maybe they experienced something similar?</Page>

            <Page>Somehow, the temperature is continuing to drop. Soon we won't be possible to survive outside for more than a few minutes without a full spacesuit.</Page>
            <Page>We've been packing up everything, that's why me and Salmon are the only ones here.</Page>
            <Page>From now on new recruits will be trained on Ravenous Tides.</Page>

            <Page>Look for radio houses. You can pick up their signals pretty easily, and they're a pretty good way to find the settlements if you get lost.</Page>
