            <Page>SV: This is South Village, do you read me North Village?</Page>
            <Page>NV: Hearing you loud and clear South Village!</Page>
            <Page>SV: Our climatologists have collected some very concerning data, this winter was colder than average, but the westerlies haven't responded normally.</Page>
            <Page>NV: What does that mean?</Page>
            <Page>SV: Normally the westerlies counteract radical temperature shifts, but they haven't this time.</Page>
            <Page>SV: This coming winter could be even colder than the last one.</Page>
            <Page>NV: That is very bad, we barely survived this winter.</Page>
            <Page>SV: There's more, you should send someone here to take a look at this data.</Page>
            <Page>NV: Will do, thanks for the information South Village, stay safe out there. North Village out.</Page>
            <Page>SV: You too. South Village out.</Page>
